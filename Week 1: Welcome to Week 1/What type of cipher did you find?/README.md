# What type of cipher did you find?
Earlier in the week you searched online for ciphers and shared the names of some of them in the discussion. Having learned about some of the different types of ciphers in Week 1, can you identify what type they are?

- Where you able to identify the type?
- Do you agree with each others' analysis of the type of cipher they found?

Share your thoughts here and read some comments from fellow learners.
