# Lesson 4: Overview
In the last lesson we learned a little about a modern day cryptographic technique called RSA. We looked at the difference between public and private key cryptography. In this lesson you will learn about how some of the modern day cryptographic techniques are used in everyday life.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- explain what end-to-end encryption is and where it is used
- explain how digital signatures can be used to prove the authenticity of a message.
