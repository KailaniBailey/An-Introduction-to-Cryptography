# Lesson 1: Overview
In this lesson, we will introduce what cryptography is and how it plays a massive role in modern day life. 

You will learn that cryptography is not a new concept, in fact it dates back at least to the ancient Greeks, so we will look at some simple **cipher** systems that were used by the Greeks and the Romans. You'll be invited to have a go at encrypting/decrypting short sentences using these ancient techniques.

By the end of this week you will be able to:

- explain where cryptography is used and the impact it has on society
- describe some simple historical ciphers
- apply simple ciphers to encrypt and decrypt messages.
