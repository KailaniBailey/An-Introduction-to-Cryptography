# Welcome to An Introduction to Cryptography
Welcome to the thrilling world of **cryptography!** Cryptography is the exciting world of secret codes and encrypted messages. It's like a puzzle that keeps your mind sharp and your information secure. 

In today's digital age, the importance of cryptography cannot be overstated: from protecting our online communications to securing our financial transactions, cryptography is at the heart of much modern technology. So, if you're looking for a thrilling and challenging field to explore, cryptography is the way to go. 

Let's dive in and discover the mathematical secrets of the cryptic world!

## Learning outcomes
The course is two weeks long. Each week of this course is centred around learning outcomes: statements which express what it is you will be able to do by the end of the course. They are a useful way of checking on how you’re progressing.

You can revisit steps as you progress through the course so that you feel confident you’re meeting the learning outcomes. As you are working through the steps and activities, you might want to refer back to this step to check your progress against the learning outcomes.

By the end of Week 1, you will be able to: 

- Describe what cryptography is
- Apply simple ciphers to encrypt and decrypt messages
- Describe how a number of simple ciphers work

By the end of Week 2, you will be able to:

- Apply modern ciphers to encrypt and decrypt messages.
- Explain the importance and common application of cryptography in modern day life.

## About the maths in this course
You may know that maths is at the heart of computing science subjects so we'll be doing some in this course, to give you an idea of the kinds of maths used in modern cryptography. We have made the exercises for these parts of the course optional, as you are not expected to know the maths, but for those of you that like a maths challenge, do give them a go! (You do not need to know the maths to pass the assignment and get your certificate).

## Gain your certificate and evidence your learning
At the end of Week 2 is a test. You can take this test as many times as you like. When you achieve 70% or more, you will be eligible for a Certificate of Achievement. This personalised Certificate of Achievement and transcript detail the syllabus and learning outcomes, as well as your end of course test score. This provides ideal evidence of your interest in and understanding of this subject. The certificate comes in both printable and digital formats, so you can easily add it to your portfolio, CV or LinkedIn profile.

## Glossary
As you complete the course you may come across terms that require further explanation. To help with this, there is a [Glossary](https://github.com/KailaniBailey/An-Introduction-to-Cryptography/blob/main/Week%201%3A%20Welcome%20to%20Week%201/Glossary.pdf) that you can view and refer to at any point in the course.
