# Lesson 3: Summary and next steps
In this lesson we have looked at some modern day cryptography. We have learned of two modern approaches: private key cryptography and public key cryptography.

We looked at a specific example of a public key cryptography technique called RSA and saw how it can be used for encryption and for digital signatures. We have learned how to generate RSA keys.

This lesson has been an introduction to modern day cryptography. You now know about the basics of modern cryptography. There is lots of advanced maths behind why modern day cryptography is secure. We won't cover it in this course but if you continue to study cryptography at some point you will encounter it.
