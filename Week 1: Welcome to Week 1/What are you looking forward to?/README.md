## My Response
> My name is Kailani and I live on planet Earth. I'm studying cybersecurity in order to better my own understanding of data and certain privacy laws that govern said data. I also love the internet, typing, and working on computers. I'm looking forward to learning more about cryptography since I'm not as familiar with ciphers. I'm also looking forward to completing the course so I can add the course certificate to my LinkedIn profile for my own professional career goals.
