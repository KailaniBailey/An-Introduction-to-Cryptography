# What do we use cryptography for now?
As you have learned, cryptography is the practice of securing information by converting it into a code that is unreadable without the proper decryption key. Cryptography has been used throughout history to protect sensitive information, such as military plans or trade secrets. However, with the increasing reliance on digital communication and the internet, cryptography has become a crucial aspect of digital security.

## Why do we need cryptography in the modern age?

Cryptography is an essential aspect of modern life, and it plays a vital role in ensuring digital security. In today's digital age, we rely on cryptography to protect our sensitive information, including financial data, medical records, and personal communication.

### Securing transactions

One of the most common uses of cryptography in modern life is to secure online transactions. When we shop online, we want to be sure that our credit card information is kept secure and confidential. Cryptography is used to encrypt this information, ensuring that it cannot be intercepted or accessed by unauthorised parties. 

The techniques that you saw in the previous lesson are far too simple to provide any reasonable level of security online. 

Securing sensitive data

Cryptography also plays a crucial role in protecting sensitive data. For example, medical records contain sensitive information about a patient's health and should only be accessible to authorised personnel. Cryptography is used to encrypt these records, ensuring that they cannot be accessed by unauthorised parties.

Securing communications

As we saw previously, another critical use of cryptography is in securing communication. With the rise of email and instant messaging, it's important to ensure that our private conversations remain confidential. Cryptography is used to encrypt these communications, ensuring that only the intended recipient can read the message.

Having investigated the 'why', let us move on to discovering the 'how' of modern cryptography: public and private key cryptography.
