# Lesson 2: Overview
In last lesson we learned about what cryptography is and what it is used for. In this lesson we will introduce some historic ciphers which are great fun to learn about and simple to understand. They aren't much good for securing data in the modern world but they do demonstrate ideas that still have a role today.

You will also learn about the different types of cipher in this lesson.

## Learning objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- understand different types of simple ciphers
- apply simple ciphers to encrypt and decrypt messages.
